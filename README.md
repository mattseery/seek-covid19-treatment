# Diagnoses seeking COVID-19 treatment
This GitHub repository contains data and code relating to a patient questionnaire conducted by a independent market research agency based in Australia.

## Brief project description
I was provided with the results of a questionnaire which included responses to diagnosed medical conditions. Patients were also asked to disclose whether they would seek medical 
treatment if diagnosed with COVID-19.

## Analysis
The chi square test and odds ratio were used to determine which patients for a type of diagnosis were more likely to seek medical treatment when testing positive for COVID-19. The analysis was performed using python in a jupyter notebook.
